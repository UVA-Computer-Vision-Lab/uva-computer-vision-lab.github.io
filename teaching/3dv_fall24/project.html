							<h3 class="post-description">Guidelines and suggestions for course projects</h3>
								<p>
                  Your course project provides an opportunity for you to explore an interesting problem in area of 3D computer vision.
                  Any topics in 3D vision, such as multiview 3D reconstruction, camera pose estimation, the interection of natual language processing and 3D vision, 
                  the applications of 3D vision in other domains (e.g. robotics, ecology), 3D recognition from images or point clouds, are all acceptable. 
                  A comprehensive topics in 3D vision can be found <a href="https://3dvconf.github.io/2025/call-for-papers/" traget="_blank">here</a>. 
                  Your project will be worth 50% of your final class grade, and will have four deliverables:
                </p>

						<ol>
							<li><strong>Proposal presentation</strong> : slides (5%)</li>
							<li><strong>Proposal abstract</strong> : 2 pages excluding references (10%)</li>
							<li><strong>Final Presentation</strong> : slides (15%)</li>
							<li><strong>Final Report</strong> : 8 pages excluding references (20%)</li>
						</ol>

						<p>All write-ups should use the <a href="https://cvpr2022.thecvf.com/sites/default/files/2021-10/cvpr2022-author_kit-v1_1-1.zip">CVPR style</a>.</p>

						<hr />

						<h3 id="team-formation">Team Formation</h3>

						<p>You are responsible for forming project teams of two or three people.
						In some cases, we will also accept smaller or larger teams, but a 2-3 person group is preferred.
						If you have trouble forming a group, please send us an email and we
						will help you find project partners.</p>

						<h3 id="scope">Scope</h3>

						<p>As a broad target, the final project should involve approximately as
						much work as a homework assignment in a typical graduate-level course for each student in the
						group. Thus the total work should scale roughly linearly with the
						group size, and be distributed roughly equally. An ambitious,
						well-done project from a group of two should be
						on the order of a conference paper in depth of experimentation.</p>

						<h3 id="project-proposal">Project Proposal</h3>

						<p>
                You must turn in a brief project proposal that provides an overview of your idea and also contains a brief survey of related work on the topic.
                We will provide a list of suggested project ideas for you to choose from.
                However, you're very encouraged to find project ideas that you are excited about.
                A great starter is the papers we will discuss in our courses. 
                We will provide feedbacks based on your project proposals and presentation. 
						</p>

						<p>Proposals should be approximately <strong>two pages long</strong>, and should include the following information:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Project title and list of group members.</li>
							<li>Overview of project idea. This should be approximately half a page long.</li>
							<li>A short literature survey of 4 or more relevant papers. The literature review should take up approximately one page.</li>
							<li>Description of potential data sets to use for the experiments.</li>
							<li>Plan of activities, including what you plan to complete by the
						presentation date and how you plan to divide up the work.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>The grading breakdown for the proposal is as follows:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>40% for clear and concise description of proposed method</li>
							<li>40% for literature survey that covers at least 4 relevant papers</li>
							<li>10% for plan of activities</li>
							<li>10% for quality of writing</li>
						</ul>

						<p>The project proposal will be due at <strong>11:59 PM on Monday, October
						14</strong>, and must be submitted via <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/828017" target="_blank">Gradescope</a>.</p>

						<h3 id="final-report">Final Report</h3>

						<p>Your final report is expected to be <strong>8 pages excluding references</strong>,
						in accordance with the length requirements for a CVPR paper. It
						should have roughly the following format:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>Introduction: problem definition and motivation</li>
							<li>Background &amp; Related Work: background info and literature survey</li>
							<li>Methods
								<ul>
									<li>Overview of your proposed method</li>
									<li>Intuition on why should it be better than the state of the art</li>
									<li>Details of models and algorithms that you developed</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Experiments
								<ul>
									<li>Description of your testbed and a list of questions your experiments are designed to answer</li>
									<li>Details of the experiments and results</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Conclusion: discussion and future work</li>
						</ul>

						<p>The grading breakdown for the final report is as follows:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>10% for introduction and literature survey</li>
							<li>30% for proposed method (soundness and originality)</li>
							<li>30% for correctness, completeness, and difficulty of experiments and figures</li>
							<li>10% for empirical and theoretical analysis of results and methods</li>
							<li>20% for quality of writing (clarity, organization, flow, etc.)</li>
						</ul>

						<p>The project final report will be due at <strong>11:59 PM on Monday, December
						9</strong>, and must be submitted via <a href="https://www.gradescope.com/courses/828017" target="_blank">Gradescope</a>.</p>

						<p><em>Note that late days do not apply to the final report.</em></p>

						<h3 id="presentation">Presentation</h3>

						<p> 
						Presentation skill is critical in your career. A good presentation should convey your project to the target audience clearly and efficiently. 
						Our course provides many great opportunies for you to practice, such as paper presentation, project proposal presentation, and final project presentation.
						</p>

						<hr />

						<h3 id="project-suggestions">Project Suggestions</h3>
						<p>You are encouraged to propose your own topics. Below are some general suggestions and constraints:</p>
						<ul>
              <li>Your project has to be related to 3D computer vision. The papers we discuss in our classes are great reference.</li>
              <li>You should be excited about your project. Do not spend time on something you don’t like.</li>
              <li>You should be comfortable about the uncertainty. Your project won't be rated by how good your experimental results are, instead, the insight you gain from your project. </li>
							<li>Read the latest papers from CVPR, ECCV, ICCV, and 3DV to find topics, software, datasets which you can build upon.</li>
							<li>The website <a href="https://paperswithcode.com">https://paperswithcode.com</a> tracks the state of the art across datasets. This is a quick way to
						find baselines to compare with or build upon.</li>
						</ul>

						<hr />

						<h3 id="computing-resources">Computing Resources</h3>

						<p>Some vision projects may involve large scale data and require GPU
						computing resources. We recommend you to check out “AWS Education” and
						“Google Cloud Platform”.</p>

						<ul>
							<li>AWS:
						<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate">https://aws.amazon.com/education/awseducate</a>
								<ul>
									<li>UMass is an “AWS member institution”, so you are in the higher
						allowance tier. Use your .edu email and the full school name
						“University of Massachusetts Amherst” when you register to get the
						full benefits (a total of $100 annually).</li>
									<li>To get GPUs, use g3 (up to 4 NVIDIA Tesla M60 GPUs) or p2 (up to 16
						NVIDIA K80 GPUs) instances in EC2. Check the pricing first and make
						your plan accordingly!</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li>Google Cloud Platform:
						<a href="https://cloud.google.com">https://cloud.google.com</a>
								<ul>
									<li>You get $300 credits for the first 12 months, and always free on
						their free-tier resources (not including GPUs)</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
						</ul>
